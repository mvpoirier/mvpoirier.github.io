title: Using LaTeX for DP Physics FE2025
---
Starting in August 2023 our DP Year 1 students will be introduced to the new DP Physics curriculum with the First Exams starting in May 2025 (FE2025). It's long overdue, but I've now recently decided the launch of the new curriculum is a great time finally learn to use **[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)** to support teaching, learning, and writing tasks for DP Physics.

### Why LaTeX & Potential Uses for DP Physics
- Provides consistent display of equations, formulas, diagrams, and graphical information
- Can be used to display DP Physics equations correctly for teacher-led presentations
- Can be used for DP Physics Extended Essay writing, either as individual copy/paste of PNG or SVG Equations via [Mathcha](https://www.mathcha.io) __or__ as a full-fledged LaTeX document using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project)

### LaTeX Resources
- [The LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
- [Mathcha Equation Editor](https://www.mathcha.io)
- [Overleaf LaTeX Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/project)
- [LaTeX YouTube Tutorial Playlist by Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxcWWkx2DMnQmj5os2X5ZR73) (Highly Recommended)

#### LaTeX Equation Example with Mathcha
Embedded document can be found [here](https://www.mathcha.io/editor/nZeKei7QSeWt1d2xDviJmPMzPUdx3yZMTYvvep). Each equation can be easily exported as a transparent SVG or PNG file which can then be copy/pasted into presentations or documents.
