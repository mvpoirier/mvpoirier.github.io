title: LaTeX & ChatGPT for DP Physics FE2025
---
Starting in August 2023 our DP Year 1 students will be introduced to the new DP Physics curriculum with the First Exams starting in May 2025 (FE2025). It's long overdue, but I've now recently decided the launch of the new curriculum is a great time finally learn to use **[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)** to support teaching, learning, and writing tasks for DP Physics.

### Why LaTeX & Potential Uses for DP Physics
- Provides consistent display of equations, formulas, diagrams, and graphical information
- Can be used to display DP Physics equations correctly for teacher-led presentations
- Can be used for DP Physics Extended Essay writing, either as individual copy/paste of PNG or SVG Equations via [Mathcha](https://www.mathcha.io) __or__ as a full-fledged LaTeX document using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project)

### LaTeX Resources
- [The LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
- [Mathcha Equation Editor](https://www.mathcha.io)
- [Overleaf LaTeX Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/project)
- [LaTeX YouTube Tutorial Playlist by Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxcWWkx2DMnQmj5os2X5ZR73) (Highly Recommended)

### Using ChatGPT for LaTeX Code Generation with Overleaf
Unsure how to begin for writing a specific equation in LaTeX, or need a head start? No problem: just ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)! After a short series of questions, the increasingly popular AI Chatbot can help provide a scaffold for writing more complicated LaTeX code.

Here's an example I made using the ChatGPT code generated with Overleaf:

### LaTeX Equation Example with Mathcha
Each equation, graph, or diagram can be easily exported as a transparent SVG or PNG file, or LaTeX source code, which can then be copy/pasted into presentations, documents, or other editors.

That's all for now,
