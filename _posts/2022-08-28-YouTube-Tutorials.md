In October 2021 I decided to have a first attempt at making a YouTube screencast tutorial to help [DP Computer Science students create Graphical User Interfaces in Java](https://youtu.be/tQPgqTJ87Kc){:target="_blank"}. Since then, I recently created a second tutorial video this month in August 2022 to help my new [DP Physics students create Graphs using Logger Pro](https://youtu.be/PINQP8pR2lo){:target="_blank"}.

They've both been very succcessful to help with technical 'how-to' skills and provide extra resources for frequently asked questions towards supporting student learning. Now that I've made a couple of these videos, I thought I'd share my process to help others too.

### How to Create YouTube Tutorials with your MacBook
Suprisingly not too challenging, using my school provided **MacBook Air** and the **QuickTime Player software** already built-in to macOS, I was able to create a fairly quick and easy to produce tutorial to support my students. A great video tutorial on how to do this on macOS can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyPrblmPp4){:target="_blank"}. The tutorial also shows how to do picture-in-picture if you want to show your face while doing your screen recording.

### What to do if you make a mistake during recording? Don't Panic!
One really important caveat to share, especially if you make a mistake *in the middle* of your 15-minute recording (or mulitple times like me), is that you can trim and crop your screencast videos as needed. A great tutorial of how to do this can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82CiWXI4rlQ){:target="_blank"}.

### How Long Does It Take to Create a Video?
Each video is about 15-20 minutes in length, and uses some very simple tools to make them. I would say **from start-to-finish each tutorial video took about 1-hour to make, edit, and post to YouTube** - not bad for something that you can use again and again each year!

### What's next?
- Use [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) to create iPad handwritten tutorials
- Experiment with *Picture-in-Picture* tutorials: could be useful, or terrifying
- How to calculate and propagate uncertainty in DP Physics from start to finish
- How to use Vernier Logger Pro video analysis tool for projectile motion
- How to solve DP Physics Paper 1, Paper 2, and Paper 3 exam-style questions

That's all for now.

All the best,

Mike
