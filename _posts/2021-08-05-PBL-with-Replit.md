A week ago I was lucky enough to attend [Replit's online workshop on Project Based Learning in Computer Science](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/replit-professional-development-project-based-learning-tickets-153561997067), where I had the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with other CS teachers and learn a lot from a collection of keynote speakers.

**Some of my big takeaways from this workshop were**:  
- [x] Use of [Python dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp) for an inventory
- [x] Providing instructions using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files within each Replit project
- [x] Scaffolding from individual excercises and skill-building to final project development
- [x] Considering the [PRIMM Framework](https://primmportal.com/) when introducing new programming concepts and tasks

**Mike's Replit Text Adventure**  
Below is my brief text adventure proof-of-concept, written in [Python](www.python.org). You can also open this code in Replit which will create your own fork where you can edit/modify it yourself! :-)
