A week ago I was lucky enough to attend [Replit's](www.replit.com) online workshop on [Project Based Learning](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/replit-professional-development-project-based-learning-tickets-153561997067), where I had the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with other CS teachers and learn a lot from a collection of keynote speakers.

**Some of my big takeaways from this workshop were**:  
- [x] Considering the [PRIMM Framework](https://primmportal.com/) when introducing new programming concepts and tasks
- [x] Using [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/) in both CS and Physics as an online and collaborative alternative to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
- [x] Considering a combination of both CodingBat and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) to help students develop the prerequsite skills and scaffolding from discrete coding excercises and *problem* based learning, towards engaging project based learning tasks.

**Mike's Replit Text Adventure**  
Below is my brief text adventure proof-of-concept, written in [Python](www.python.org). You can also open this code in Replit which will create your own fork where you can edit/modify it yourself! :-)

A few interesting things learned from this PD excercise:
- [x] Use of [Python dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp) to keep track of inventory items in any 'adventure game' format
- [x] Providing instructions using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files within each Replit project to help guide and support student learning
