Grade 12 Computer Science Class of 2020, welcome to your new **probject based learning (PBL) assignment for DP Computer Science**. This group is meant for students who want to challenge themselves and learn some useful and advanced skills relating to **Github Repositories, Github Pages, P5.JS, Visual Studio Code workflows**, and other useful ideas which will prove to be beneficial after your graduation.

We will be following **Daniel Shiffman's** excellent [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com) tutorials on P5.JS. This is an excellent opportunity for you to learn at your own pace, and create projects that you can share with others through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), to slowly build your own personal portfolio of work.

**Goals & Expectations for this Project Based Learning Group:**
1. Complete the coding train tutorial lessons on P5.JS [here](https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/p5js/).
2. Visit the [Coding Train YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/featured) and choose a Coding Challenge to complete. For example: [Coding Challenge 31 - Flappy Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY).
3. Create a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/), where you will document your learning as a journal and coding porfolio, and share your coding projects (embed P5.JS files like [this](https://mvpoirier.github.io/compsci/) for extra street cred).
4. Visit each others Github Page portfolios and check out each other's projects.

**Timeline and Schedule**
- April 6: Launch Groups
- April 7: Discussion, Q&A, Feedback on [Mr. Poirier's Cisco Webex](https://abaoman.webex.com/meet/mpoirier)
- April 13: Progress, Q&A, Feedback on [Mr. Poirier's Cisco Webex](https://abaoman.webex.com/meet/mpoirier)
- April 14: Progress, Q&A, Feedback on [Mr. Poirier's Cisco Webex](https://abaoman.webex.com/meet/mpoirier)
- April 20: Finish Coding Challenge Product, Journal (Github Page), and Internal Group Testing
- April 21: Celebration with all DP Computer Science Students (Show & Tell)

I hope this can be a very productive and engaging remaining weeks as we learn some more valuable skills in Computer Science.
