title: Reflecting on DP Physics FE2025
---
With the [newest revision to the IB DP Physics curriculum](https://www.ibo.org/university-admission/latest-curriculum-updates/physics-updates/) starting August 2023 (First Exams May 2025) now well underway, I thought it would be a good time to briefly reflect on the first semester tackling this new course - the good, the bad, and the _ugly_.

## The Good
- All major textbook publishers have provided great resources that outline new curriculum changes
- [Kognity](https://kognity.com/) is a very useful tool for both students and teachers
- I've made good progress on [developing new resources for DP Physics FE2025](/physics_dp_2025)

## The Bad
- Not having an explicit Measurements & Uncertainties unit (Topic 1) seems counterintuitive

## The Ugly
- Integrating the _Skills in the Study of Physics_ is not easy, and requires careful planning
- The new guide lacks deliniated curriculum learning outcomes

## Next Steps
- Continue developing and refining resources for all topics


All the best,

Mike
