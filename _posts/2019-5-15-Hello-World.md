## Purpose
To share information with students and colleagues relating to what I'm working on in education, relating to **physics**, **computer science**, and **robotics**.

### How This Site Works:
This is my first blog post using [Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), running on [GitHub Pages](https://mvpoirier.github.io/).

The code hosted on <http://github.com/mvpoirier/> and edited using [prose.io](https://prose.io).

### Reminder to Myself:
To add more posts: go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

### Testing with Code Blocks in Markdown
To add code blocks, use triple 'backticks' to start syntax highlighting "\\\":
\\\ public static void main (String[] args){
\\\		System.out.println("Hello World!");
\\\ }
