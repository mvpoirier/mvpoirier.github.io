title: Gearing Up for DP Physics FE2025 IA
---
With the [newest revision to the IB DP Physics curriculum](https://www.ibo.org/university-admission/latest-curriculum-updates/physics-updates/) starting August 2023 (First Exams May 2025) now well underway, we're now starting to introduce the new Internal Assessment guide to our students.

## The Rubric
- All major textbook publishers have provided great resources that outline new curriculum changes
- [Kognity](https://kognity.com/) is a very useful tool for both students and teachers
- Developed new resources for DP Physics FE2025, some are shared [here](/physics_dp_2025)

## The Bad
- Not having an explicit Measurements & Uncertainties unit (Topic 1) seems counterintuitive
- Difficult to provide the upskilling needed for students to be successful on practical work

## The Ugly
- Integrating the _Skills in the Study of Physics_ is not easy, and requires careful planning
- The new guide lacks deliniated/numbered curriculum learning outcomes for reference

## Next Steps
- Continue developing and refining resources for all topics
- Begin developing resources for the new HL Only Topics: A4, B4, A5


All the best,

Mike
