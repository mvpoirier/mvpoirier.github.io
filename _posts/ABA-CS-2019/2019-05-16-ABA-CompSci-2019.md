## How to Make Course Blog using Jekyll & Categories

- Develop a separate folder in _posts_: ABA-CS-2019  
  
- The course page _course/ABA-CS-2019-2020.html_ uses a **post category** called _ABA-CS-2019_ when handeling posts located in subdirectories such as _\_posts/ABA-CS-2019/_ as shown written in the [Jekyll Liquid Template Language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and CSS:  
  
```html
<div class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  	{% if post.path contains 'ABA-CS-2019' %}
  		<article class="post">
          	<h1><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>
      
        	<div class="date">
          		{{ post.date | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}
        	</div>
      
        	<div class="entry">
              	{{ post.content }}
        	</div>
  		</article>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```  
  
- The layout of how posts are displayed are also changed from _{{ post.excerpt }}_ to _{{ post.content}}_ so that all posts are displayed in full when on the course page, but only short summaries (excerpts) are displayed on the front page of the site.
