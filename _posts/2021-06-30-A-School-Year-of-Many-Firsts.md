## Reflecting in Quarantine
While my wife and I wait out the remaining few days of our 14-day quarantine since returning to Canada, I thought it's probably a good time to reflect on the past 18 months since the COVID-19 pandemic changed how we approach teaching and learning. No question the 2020-2021 school year has been a challenge for students, parents, teachers, and schools to adapt with the changing times.

#### What did I learn from all of this?

#### What can I take with me going forward?

I've wondered lately what have we done in the past 18 months which can be built upon, expanded, and potentially brought forward into the classroom as we all prepare for face-to-face learning to come back again.

A few things that come to mind that I hope to continue and learned:
- [x] Digital whiteboards to record lessons and classroom activities
- [x] A more integrated approach to using technology to leverage learning
- [x] Developing scaffolded activities to support independent learning
- [x] Developing video tutorials to support at-home learning
