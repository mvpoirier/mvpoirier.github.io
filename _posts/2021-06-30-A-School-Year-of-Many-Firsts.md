title: Another School Year of Many Firsts!

While my wife and I wait out the remaining few days of our [14-day quarantine since returning to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html), I thought it's probably a good time to reflect on the *blur* that has been the past 18 months since the COVID-19 changed how we've had to approach teaching and learning during a pandemic. **What did I learn from all of this? What can I take with me going forward?**

## Memes aside, what did I walk away with this year?
Better things to come?

## The Continued Impact of COVID-19
While vaccination rates have stalled in some countries, or simply have failed to get started in others, it appears that COVID-19 will continue to have a lasting impact into the 2021-2022 school year and beyond.

## What could be next?
- Update program with a video capture feed (webcam) for real-time image detection.
- Detecting human postures with [COCO DensePose](http://densepose.org/).
- Implement a physics demo with [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/).
- Implement a multiplayer demo with [socket.io](https://socket.io/).
