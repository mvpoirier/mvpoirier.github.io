With the [newest revision to the IB DP Physics curriculum](https://www.ibo.org/university-admission/latest-curriculum-updates/physics-updates/) starting August 2023 (First Exams May 2025) now well underway, I thought it would be a good time to briefly reflect on the first semester with this new course - the good, the bad, and the _ugly_.


## The Good
- All major textbook publishers have provided great resources that outline new curriculum changes
- [Kognity](https://kognity.com/) continues to be an extremly powerful and useful tool for both teachers and students
- Have made good progress on [developing updated resoruces for DP Physics FE2025](/physics_dp_2025)

## The Bad


## The Ugly
- Not having an explicit Measurements & Uncertainties unit (Topic 1) is a big challenge
- Integrating the _Skills in the Study of Physics_ is not easy, and requires careful planning

## Next Steps
- Continue developing resources for all topics


All the best,

Mike
