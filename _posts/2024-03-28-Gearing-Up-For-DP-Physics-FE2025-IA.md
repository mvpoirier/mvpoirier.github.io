title: Gearing Up for DP Physics FE2025 IA
---
With the [newest revision to the IB DP Physics curriculum](https://www.ibo.org/university-admission/latest-curriculum-updates/physics-updates/) now well underway (First Exams 2025), we're beginning to introduce the new Internal Assessment (IA) to our students. Below are a few resources I've developed to support the new DP Physics FE2025 IA, and hopefully can help support your classes too.

## DP Physics: Skills in the Study of Physics (SSP)
With the removal of [Topic 1: Measurement and Uncertainties](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XcXfXtDnE3UuL7zyR2QwfJJZTI3B6i8D/view?usp=sharing), its a new challenge for teachers to prepare students with the knowledge, concepts, and skills required to be successful on their IA. This is my attempt to fill the gap with some resources to support teaching the required *Skills in the Study of Physics* (SSP):

## DP Physics IA: Assessment Rubric
A student and teacher-friendly IA Rubric for DP Physics FE2025. It also includes a student reminder checklist, and a chance for students to predict their own score before submitting both their draft and final submission.

## DP Physics IA: Student Checklist
An IA student checklist for each of the IA Criteria, to provide students more specific guidance as they develop their IA draft & final report during our 10 in-class hours.

## DP Physics IA: Lab Report Headings Guide
A brief guide for students to remember the major headings/sections of the IA lab report process. It's not an exhaustive list, and students are encouraged to find their own writing style while still meeting all IA criteria requirements.

## DP Physics IA: Topic Approval Form
My approach for students to begin brainstorming their IA ideas, usually ocurring around the 1st week of April in DP Year 1. Their topics will need to be finalized and approved before summer break.

## DP Physics IA: Topic/RQ Student Archive from 2016 to 2024
A summary of successful IA submissions from former students I've taught in the past, shared to help others generate meaningful topic/RQ ideas. Its important that for my students, once they find an idea, they must convince me how their investigation will be unique & different from others.

## Where Are We Now?
- DP Year 1 students have completed Topics A1-3, B1, B3, B5, C1-4, A4(HL), and now starting B4(HL)
- Remaining for DP Year 1: D2, D3, and finalizing their IA Topic
- We feel like we're in a good spot right now for students to begin the IA process

## Where Are We Going?
- Continue developing [FE2025 DP Physics Resources](/physics_dp_2025) to support teaching & learning
- Look ahead to DP Year 2, to make sure students will be successful on both their IAs and Exams
- You can explore our current teaching timeline for DP Physics FE2025 here:

All the best,
