title: Graphing in DP Physics
layout: post
---

One of the more challenging aspects of the **DP Physics Internal Assessment** is how students collect, calculate, and graphically represent numerical relationships and uncertainties. There are a few ways to do this well, which usually requires the knowledge and application of software, including:  
  
1. Google Sheets
2. Microsoft Excel
3. Vernier Logger Pro
4. Python and Jupyter Notebooks

My goal for this article is to outline how to create rigorous DP Physics-level graphs using all four of these tools, which will hopefully help both students and teachers when developing their 12-page IA investigations. A requirement for these graphs are that they must display:

- Error bars
- Lines of Best Fit - LOBFs (average, maximum, minimum)
- Linear equations of all LOBFs
