- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.io/) at <https://mvpoirier.github.io/>
- Edited online using the [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) online editor
- A majority of the pages are coded using Markdown
- This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

- Communicate with students and colleagues on what I'm doing relating to education, physics, and computer science

- Take advantage of the syntax-highlighting capabilities of Jekyll and rogue when teaching comptuer science
- Have a way to keep track of posts and progress across classes, over many years (e.g. DP Physics Year 1 & 2)
- Have a place to archive what I'm doing between different schools, with more ownership rights
