# What is this site?
- It's using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator that is perfect for GitHub hosted blogs
- Based on a fork of the [Jekyll Now Theme](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/), which allows instant use on GitHub
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.io/) at <https://mvpoirier.github.io/>
- Edited online using the [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) online editor and with [Git & GitHub on VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cMWR-EGFuY)
- Developed with majority of the pages coded using Markdown, for readability
- This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy
