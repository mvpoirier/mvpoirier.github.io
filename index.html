{{ '## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
  
My name is Mike Poirier, and I am interested in science education, physics, and computer science.<br>

I have been teaching internationally since 2009, and created this site to help share some of the things I have made or found over the years to support teaching and learning. I hope that some the [Physics](/physics) and [Coding](/coding) resources are useful for you.<br>

If you are interested in continuing the conversation, you can connect with me online at a few different places linked at the bottom of the website.<br><br>
