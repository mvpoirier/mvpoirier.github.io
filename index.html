I have been teaching internationally since 2009, and made this site to help share things I have made or have found useful over the years to support my teaching. I hope that the [Physics](/physics) and [Coding](/coding) resources shared can be useful for you too.<br>

Currently I am living and teaching in Bangkok, Thailand. If you are at all interested in continuing the conversation, you can find me online at a few different places linked at the bottom of the website.' | markdownify }}
