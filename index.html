{{ '## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
  
My name is Mike Poirier, and I am interested in science education, physics, computer science, and STEM.<br>

I have been teaching internationally since 2009, and made this site to help share things I have made or have found useful over the years to support my teaching. I hope that the [Physics](/physics) and [Coding](/coding) resources shared can be useful for you.<br>

Currently I am living and teaching in Bangkok, Thailand. If you are at all interested in continuing the conversation, you can find me online at a few different places linked at the bottom of the website.<br>
  
All the best,<br><br>Mike
