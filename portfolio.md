## Welcome to my online portfolio!
  
I hope the information, resources, and photos collected and shared below will help illustrate the potential benefit and impact I can make at your school. You can also find out more about my qualifications, experience, and interests on my **[CV/Résumé](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1glDde-ajDM7koyvnCMvvCRr3JIPvvafF/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}**, **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvpoirier8){:target="_blank"}**, and **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mvpoirier){:target="_blank"}**.

#### As an international educator...
- I value the pastoral role that teachers have in the day-to-day lives of our students

#### As a physics teacher...
- I value having students [make their thinking visible](https://pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines)
- I value how students *arrive* at the final answer: the journey vs. the destination
- I focus and place emphasis on *unit analysis* as a distinction between math and physics
- I value practical work as an important part of developing students' conceptual understanding

#### As a computer science teacher...
- I find that collaboration and peer work is a crucial aspect of good coding practice

#### As a colleague...
- I value respectful dialogue and following the *Norms of Collaboration*
- I try to celebrate our differences, and be involved in the school community
- I enjoy making friends both in and out of school, and value those relationships
