## Michael Poirier's Online Portfolio
  
My wife [Amy Ivany (PYP & Early Childhood Educator)](https://sites.google.com/view/amyivanyportfolio) and I are grateful to have been teaching overseas now for over 10 years at international schools in China, South Korea, and Oman. We are excited to continue this adventure and grow as teachers, global citizens, and lifelong learners. It's my hope that the information shared below will help illustrate the potential impact I can make at your school.

- I reflect regularly as part of my teaching practice, and try to model lifelong learning

#### As a colleague...
- I value respectful and productive dialogue following The Norms of Collaboration
- I can be trusted to meet deadlines and expectations, and help others when needed
- I focus my goals and actions on what is needed for effective student learning to take place
- I am proactive to clarify misunderstandings with others, and work towards next steps
- I strive for a healthy work-life balance, and value the well-being of those around me

#### As a science teacher...
- I invite students to inquire about the natural world, and make their thinking visible
- I view practical work as a critical part of developing students' conceptual understanding
- I scaffold learning tasks and outcomes to help guide students on how to be successful
- I leverage technology and online tools to enhance the learning experience
- I emphasize the learning journey, and try to cultivate a growth mindset
