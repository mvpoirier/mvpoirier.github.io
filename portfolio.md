## Welcome to my online portfolio!
  
My wife [Amy Ivany](https://sites.google.com/view/amyivanyportfolio) and I are grateful to have been teaching overseas now for over 10 years at international schools in China, South Korea, and Oman. We are excited to continue this adventure and grow as teachers, global citizens, and lifelong learners.

#### As an international educator...
- I value the pastoral role that teachers have in the day-to-day lives of our students
- I recognize the need to celebrate our differences and share our cultures with each other
- I try to be involved in the school community, and make authentic connections with others
- I am grateful to be a part of a caring and professional teaching community

#### As a physics and computer science teacher...
- I value having students [make their thinking visible](https://pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines){:target="_blank"}
- I value *how* students arrive at the final answer: the journey vs. the destination
- I value practical work as an important part of developing students' conceptual understanding
- I find that collaboration and communication are vital for both good teaching and effective student learning
- I try to leverage technology and online tools, when needed, to enhance the learning experience
- I scaffold lessons and assessments so that students learn and know how to be successful
- I place emphasis on the learning journey, and try to cultivate a *growth mindset* towards learning

#### As a colleague...
- I value respectful and productive dialogue and following the [Norms of Collaboration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XRhRGtsAmd1xsIBP97jlvEeLmLhFTHSd/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
- I am proactive in meeting with colleagues to clarify misunderstandings and next steps
- I can be trusted to meet deadlines, expectations, and help others when needed
- I value the well-being of those around me, and strive for a healthy work-life balance
